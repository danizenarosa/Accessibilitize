A Google Chrome extension for making websites easier to read for those with Dyslexia and Colour-Blindness



## User-Stories
### Dyslexia-specific
* Non-sans-serif fonts are harder to read, make sure all fonts are sans-serif (like Arial or Verdana)
* Font size that is less than 16px is harder to read, make sure all fonts are at least 16px
* Fonts with the letters too close together are harder to read, make sure inter-letter spacing is around 35% of letter width
* Make spaces clear and distinct from inter-letter spacing by having spaces be at least 3.5x wider than inter-letter spacing
* Make inter-line spacing ~1.5x the size of inter-word spacing
* Underlines and italicized words make letters run together, replace all emphasis with bolds
* Remove sections that are all-caps

### Color blindnes-specific
* Change website's colour palette to presets catered towards specific types of colour blindness
* Color contrast ratio should be 7:1 for normal text and 4.5:1 for large text to ensure readability through high color contrast
* Eliminate problematic color combinations (e.g. red-green, blue-purple) for colorblind users
* Website fonts are bolded for better readability
